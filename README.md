<p>When the menu button is clicked, the primary content container rotates and reveals the nav menu.</p>

<p>The items of the nav menu are positioned off-screen and animate over to fill in the new blank space created by the rotation.</p>

<p>They then animate back off-screen when the close button is clicked and the page rotates back to its original position.</p>
